Perkoars are elements that make up a system of relationships that can vary depending on the number of perkoars near the center. 
When this significant number of perkoars are far from the center, it is possible that a total blockage of the system's operation occurs. 
Sometimes you can find some darguiens among the perkoars, you can notice the difference by their size and speed.
Darguiens are faster than perkoars, but at the same time they have less capacity to change their route when they transit through the system. 
During blockages it is important to have a certain number of darguiens because they are the ones that activate the blocked perkoars, whenever they spend some time near them. 
During normal system operation it is very unlikely that large numbers of perkoars will gather because they naturally repel each other when they have normal behavior.
